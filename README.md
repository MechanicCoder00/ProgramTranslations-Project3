Author: Scott Tabaka
CMPSCI 4280 Project3
Purpose: This project tests the static semantics of a program using local scope.  It will check to make sure all
    variables are declared before use and that duplicate declarations do not happen.  Error messages will be given for
    each if improper use is detected.
